Here, you will find a collection of my notes on a variety of topics. Click through links, read, and see where you end up.

The easiest way to get started is to read this [step-by-step guide explaining how to set this up from scratch](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll).
